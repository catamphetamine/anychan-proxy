Enables cross-origin HTTP requests (CORS) from a web browser to anywhere.

## Use

`/<url>` or `/?url=<encodeURIComponent(url)>` â€” Proxies an HTTP request to `<url>`, and adds CORS headers to the HTTP response.

## Cookies

Cookies are included in HTTP requests and HTTP responses.

## Redirects

Redirects are automatically followed. For debugging purposes, each followed redirect results
in the addition of a `X-CORS-Redirect-n` header, where `n` starts at `1`. These headers are not
accessible by the `XMLHttpRequest` API.

After 5 redirects, redirects are not followed any more. The redirect response is sent back
to the browser, which can choose to follow the redirect (handled automatically by the browser).

## Headers

The requested URL is available in the `X-Request-URL` response header.
The final URL, after following all redirects, is available in the X-Final-URL response header.

To prevent the use of the proxy for casual browsing, the API requires either the `Origin`
or the `X-Requested-With` header to be set.

<!-- To avoid unnecessary preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests, it's recommended to not manually set these headers in your code. What? -->
